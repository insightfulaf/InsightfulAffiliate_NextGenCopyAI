# Prompt to Profit Templates

This folder contains prompt packs and SOPs that support the Prompt to Profit playbook. Use these as modular building blocks when running the agent or crafting manual prompts.

- `bloggers/`: Prompts, workflows, and SOPs for blog-focused campaigns.
- `course_info/`: Prompts, workflows, and SOPs for course/product detail capture.
- `ecom/`: Prompts, workflows, and SOPs for ecommerce offers.
- `hooks.md`: Hook and headline prompt starters.
- `shortform-scripts.md`: Short-form script prompts (social/video/email snippets).

Usage: include the relevant file(s) with your `--prompt` argument in `scripts/agent_codex.py`, or copy/paste into your prompt authoring workflow. Keep this directory as the canonical source; do not duplicate elsewhere.
